ddr-explorer Setup
================

This page documents the process of installing and configuring `ddr-explorer` on an existing Debian Linux machine.

Most of the commands you will type will be entered as `root`.  To become `root`, type the following at a command prompt::

    $ su - root
    [enter root password]

As per convention, variables in this documentation are written in upper case with underscores, starting with a "$" sign.



DDR Applications and Dependencies - Automated Installation
==========================================================

In this section we will use a script to automatically install the DDR code and its supporting applications.

Log in to your VM and become `root`.  Then add a `ddr` user, install the prerequisites, and install the `ddr-explorer` app itself.::

    # adduser ddr
    [enter info]
    # apt-get install git-core
    # git clone https://github.com/densho/ddr-explorer.git /opt/ddr-explorer
    # cd /opt/ddr-explorer

    # If you are testing a branch, switch to that branch.
    # git checkout -b BRANCHNAME origin/BRANCHNAME
    
    # make install

Wait as Make installs Debian packages and Python code and builds up your system.  On a basic VM this takes between 5-10 minutes.



Configuration
=============

The default settings in `/etc/ddr/ddrexplorer.cfg` are specific to the Densho production system.  Settings in `/etc/ddr/ddrexplorer-local.cfg` will override the defaults.

Edit `/etc/ddr/ddrexplorer-local.cfg` to include the following text.::

    [public]

    # IP address and port of the Elasticsearch node.
    docstore_host=127.0.0.1:9200
    # Name of the index you wish to use (e.g. "encyc-production", "encyc-stage", "encyc-dev").
    docstore_index=encyc-dev

To get the nice Django error messages edit `/opt/ddr-explorer/ddrexplorer/ddrexplorer/settings.py`.  **WARNING: setting `DEBUG = True` in a production environment is a security risk!**::

    DEBUG = True
    THUMBNAIL_DEBUG = False

`ddr-explorer` uses the Django ORM to store data in a MariaDB database.  Create database tables for installed applications.::

    # make syncdb

Restart the servers and the web application to see the effects of your edits.::

    # make restart

At this point `ddr-explorer` is installed but the database contains no data.
